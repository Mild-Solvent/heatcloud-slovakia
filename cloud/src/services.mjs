      <p>The commercial shape is a heat purchase agreement of 10 to 15 years, priced at a fixed
      discount to your delivered gas heat cost and indexed to the same gas benchmark, so the
      discount holds whichever way the gas price moves. You keep the customer relationship and the
      network; we deliver hot water at your primary temperature into your substation.</p>`,
    features: [
      { title: 'Priced against your actual alternative', body: 'The reference is your delivered cost of gas-fired heat, not a spot index you cannot hedge. The contract quotes a percentage discount to it.' },
      { title: 'We take the technical risk', body: 'Heat pumps, exchangers, controls and the interconnection to your substation are our capex and our maintenance obligation, up to an agreed delivery point.' },
      { title: 'Backup by design', body: 'Your existing plant stays as backup and peak capacity. Recovered heat is a base-load contribution, typically 20–40% of annual network demand at the scale we build.' },
      { title: 'The funding stack is part of the deal', body: 'Modernisation Fund, Programme Slovakia and ELENA/EIB instruments are aimed exactly at this. We prepare the applications; the thermal asset is what gets funded.' },
      { title: 'Metered and auditable', body: 'Delivery is metered at the substation to the same standard as any other heat source on your network, with the data available to you continuously.' },
      { title: 'Efficiency obligations, satisfied', body: 'Waste-heat integration counts towards the efficient district heating criteria under EED 2023/1791 — the direction the regulation is already pushing you.' },

      ['What do you need from us to start?', 'Your network primary and return temperatures, an annual load profile, the location of candidate substations, and your current delivered heat cost. That is enough for an indicative term sheet.'],
      ['What if your datacenter is empty?', 'The contract carries a minimum annual delivery with liquidated damages, backed by our own gas or electric boiler as the fallback. You are not exposed to our sales pipeline.'],
      ['Why is the heat cheaper than gas?', 'Because we are already paid for the electricity by our compute customers. The heat is a by-product with a marginal cost of the heat-pump electricity plus maintenance — well under the cost of burning gas for the same joule.'],
      ['Is this proven anywhere?', 'Yes. Infomaniak’s D4 datacenter in Geneva has fed roughly its entire electrical consumption into the Geneva network as heat since November 2024, at 1.7 MW thermal. The research dossier this company grew out of documents that and the Slovak numbers behind it.'],
