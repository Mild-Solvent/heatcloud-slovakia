        give at least 30 days’ notice and the Customer may terminate the affected Service without

        where applicable. Business customers established in another EU Member State with a valid
        VAT identification number are invoiced under the reverse charge.</p>
        <p>Subscription Services are invoiced in advance for each Billing Period. Metered Services
        are invoiced in arrears based on our measurement records, which are decisive absent
        manifest error. Invoices are issued electronically and are due <b>14 days</b> from issue
        unless otherwise agreed.</p>
        <p>Accepted methods are payment card, SEPA direct debit and bank transfer. Public bodies
        and business customers above an agreed monthly volume may request purchase-order handling
        and 30-day terms.</p>
        <p><b>Price changes.</b> We may change prices with at least 30 days’ written notice. The
        Customer may terminate the affected Service without penalty before the change takes
        effect. Third-party registry and licence fees (notably domain registry fees) are passed
        through at cost and may change with the notice the registry gives us. Prices for a
        prepaid annual term do not change during that term.</p>` },

          retained and remains exportable by the Customer.</li>

          Content may be permanently deleted.</li>

        <p>We may also suspend a Service immediately, without the above steps, where required by
        law, where continued operation presents a serious security risk to us or third parties, or

        least 30 days before the renewal date. <b>Renewal is at the same price as the expiring

        <p>Either party may terminate for convenience with effect from the end of the current
        Billing Period, by notice through the Account or in writing. There is no cancellation fee.
        Prepaid annual fees are not refunded on termination for convenience.</p>
        <p>Either party may terminate any Service with immediate effect for material breach that
        is not remedied within 14 days of written notice, or immediately and without notice on the
        other party’s insolvency. We may terminate immediately for a serious or repeated breach of
        the AUP.</p>
        <p><b>After termination.</b> Customer Content remains available for export for 30 days,
        after which it is deleted. On request within that period we will provide reasonable
        assistance with migration at our standard rates; we do not charge for the egress
        bandwidth.</p>` },

        <p>Availability commitments and the credits payable if we miss them are set out in the
        <a href="/legal/sla/">SLA</a>. Service credits are the Customer’s sole and exclusive
        financial remedy for failure to meet an availability commitment, without prejudice to the
        right to terminate for material breach under clause 8.</p>` },

      { h: 'Customer Content and data', body: `
        <p>Customer Content remains the Customer’s property. We acquire no rights in it other than
        the limited rights necessary to provide the Services. We do not access Customer Content
        except where necessary to provide or protect the Services, where the Customer asks us to,
        or where we are legally required to; such access is logged and available to the Customer on
        request.</p>
        <p>We do not use Customer Content for advertising, profiling, or the training of machine
        learning models. This is a contractual obligation, not a policy we can change unilaterally.</p>
        <p>Customer Content is stored in the Slovak region selected by the Customer. Where we
        process personal data on the Customer’s behalf, the <a href="/legal/dpa/">DPA</a> applies
        and forms part of this contract.</p>
        <p>Where we are legally compelled to disclose Customer Content, we will inform the Customer
        before disclosure unless legally prohibited from doing so, and will disclose only what the
        instrument actually requires.</p>` },

      { h: 'Intellectual property', body: `
        <p>We retain all rights in the Services, our software, documentation and trade marks. The
        Customer receives a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use them for the duration of
        the contract and for its intended purpose.</p>
        <p>Open-source components are licensed under their own terms, which prevail over these
        Terms for those components. Where a Service is built on an open-source project we say so on
        its service page.</p>` },

      { h: 'Warranties and liability', body: `
        <p>We warrant that the Services will be provided with reasonable skill and care and will
        materially conform to their published description. To the extent permitted by law, all
        other warranties are excluded.</p>
        <p><b>Cap.</b> Our aggregate liability arising in any twelve-month period is limited to the
        total fees paid by the Customer for the affected Service in the twelve months preceding the
        event giving rise to the claim.</p>
        <p><b>Excluded loss.</b> We are not liable for loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of
        anticipated savings, loss of goodwill, or for loss or corruption of data to the extent the
        Customer could have avoided it by maintaining backups in accordance with clause 5.</p>
        <p><b>What is never limited.</b> Nothing in these Terms limits liability for death or
        personal injury caused by negligence, for damage caused intentionally or by gross
        negligence, for fraud, or for any liability that cannot be limited under Slovak law. For
        Consumers, nothing in this clause affects statutory rights.</p>` },

      { h: 'Indemnity', body: `
        <p>The Customer shall indemnify us against third-party claims arising from Customer Content
        or from the Customer’s use of the Services in breach of these Terms or the AUP, including
        reasonable legal costs. We will notify the Customer promptly of any such claim, allow the
        Customer to participate in the defence, and not settle without the Customer’s consent,
        which shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>` },

      { h: 'Changes to these Terms', body: `
        <p>We may amend these Terms with at least 30 days’ written notice. If the amendment
        materially disadvantages the Customer, the Customer may terminate the affected Services
        without penalty before it takes effect; continued use after that date constitutes
        acceptance. Amendments required by law take effect on the date the law requires.</p>
        <p>Every version of these Terms is archived and available on request, so that a Customer
        can establish what was agreed at any given time.</p>` },

      { h: 'Force majeure', body: `
        <p>Neither party is liable for failure to perform caused by an event beyond its reasonable
        control, including natural disaster, war, terrorism, general failure of the electricity or
        telecommunications network, or acts of public authority. Force majeure does not excuse
        payment of amounts already due. If the event continues for more than 30 days, either party
        may terminate the affected Service without liability.</p>` },

      { h: 'Confidentiality', body: `
        <p>Each party shall keep confidential the other’s non-public information disclosed in
        connection with the contract, use it only for the purposes of the contract, and protect it
        with at least the care it applies to its own confidential information. This obligation
        survives termination by three years, and indefinitely for Customer Content.</p>` },

      { h: 'Assignment and subcontracting', body: `
        <p>The Customer may not assign the contract without our written consent, which will not be
        unreasonably withheld. We may assign the contract to a successor of our business on notice.
        We may use subcontractors, including the sub-processors listed in the
        <a href="/legal/dpa/">DPA</a>, and remain fully responsible for their performance.</p>` },

      { h: 'Consumers', body: `
        <p>This clause applies only where the Customer is a Consumer, and prevails over any
        conflicting provision of these Terms.</p>
        <p><b>Right of withdrawal.</b> Under Act No. 102/2014 Coll., a Consumer may withdraw from a
        distance contract within 14 days without giving a reason, by any unambiguous statement sent
        to <a href="mailto:${company.email}">${company.email}</a>. Where the Consumer has asked us
        to begin providing the Service during that period, and the Service has been fully
        provided, the right of withdrawal is lost; where partially provided, the Consumer pays a
        proportionate amount for what was provided. We refund within 14 days of being informed,
        using the same payment method.</p>
        <p><b>Complaints.</b> Complaints may be sent to <a href="mailto:${company.email}">${company.email}</a>
        and are acknowledged immediately and resolved within 30 days.</p>
        <p><b>Alternative dispute resolution.</b> A Consumer may address an unresolved complaint to
        the Slovak Trade Inspection (Slovenská obchodná inšpekcia) as the general ADR body, or use
        the European online dispute resolution platform. Nothing in these Terms deprives a Consumer
        of the protection of mandatory Slovak consumer law.</p>` },

      { h: 'Governing law and jurisdiction', body: `
        <p>These Terms are governed by the law of the Slovak Republic, excluding its conflict-of-law
        rules and excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
        The courts of the Slovak Republic have jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>For Consumers, this choice does not deprive the Consumer of the protection of the
        mandatory law of their country of habitual residence, and a Consumer may bring proceedings
        in the courts of that country.</p>` },

      { h: 'Final provisions', body: `
        <p>If any provision is or becomes invalid, the remainder stays in force and the invalid
        provision is replaced by one that comes closest to its commercial intent.</p>
        <p>Failure to enforce a right is not a waiver of it. There are no oral side agreements;
        amendments must be in writing. Notices to us go to
        <a href="mailto:${company.email}">${company.email}</a>; notices to the Customer go to the
        email address on the Account.</p>
        <p>These Terms are published in English and Slovak. Where the versions diverge, the Slovak
        version prevails for Consumers resident in Slovakia and the English version prevails
        otherwise. <i>(The Slovak version has not yet been prepared for this preview.)</i></p>` },
